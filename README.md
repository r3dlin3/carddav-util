carddav-util
============

*carddav-util* is a python script capable of processing contact information
at CardDAV servers. In particular it can move contact information between
a CardDAV server and a local file; it dumps entire addressbooks to a vCard
file and then may be used re-upload them to another CardDAV server.

Requirements
------------

The following python libraries are required:

 * requests
 * vobject
 * lxml

On ubuntu:

    sudo apt-get install python-requests python-vobject python-lxml

Usage
-----

### ownCloud:

    ./carddav-util.py   \
        --download      \
        --user=username \
        --file=test.vcf \
        --url=https://domain.com/owncloud/remote.php/carddav/addressbooks/username/contacts

### Ba√Økal:

    ./carddav-util.py   \
        --download      \
        --digest       \
        --user=username \
        --file=test.vcf \
        --url=https://domain.com/baikal/card.php/addressbooks/username/bookid

Where:
 * username is your username - the one that you specified on the commandline
 * bookid is the identifier of your addressbook

Authentication:
 * If your server uses digest authentication, you need to add *--digest*.

Regenerating the formated name (FN) tag:

    ./carddav-util.py   \
        --fixfn         \
        --user=username \
        --file=dummy    \
        --url=https://domain.com/baikal/card.php/addressbooks/username/bookid

This overwrites the formated name tag with a string created from the following
name fields in the following order: *prefix first_name middle_name family_name
suffix*
